The United Nations, with its 193 member states, established 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) during the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Summit. These SDGs aim to comprehensively address development issues across the social, economic, and environmental dimensions from 2015 to 2030.

The Fudan iGEM 2023, as advocate and user of synthetic biology technology, has consistently placed a significant emphasis on the principles of sustainable development throughout the progress of the B.HOME project. We have integrated the relevant SDGs concepts into a series of educational and human practice activities related to our project. Through our activities, we aim to enhance the influence of SDGs-related concepts among the public. To align with the B.HOME project's objectives, we have focused on implementing **SDG4-quality education**, **SDG13-climate action**, and **SDG15-life on land**.

Furthermore, as the project has advanced, we've come to realize that SDGs are closely intertwined with our lives. Therefore, implementing SDGs concepts into our project's human practices, education, experiments, and other aspects may yield more significant results compared to solely designing social activities related to SDGs.



## SDG4 Quality Education

**SDG4-quality education** reflects the importance placed by UN member states on inclusive, equitable, and quality education, as well as equal educational opportunities for all. We believe that the quality of education in a region is not only reflected in statistical figures such as adult literacy rates and mean years of schooling but also requires consideration of **the richness of educational resources in different regions**. The popularity of interest courses, such as synthetic biology and astronomy, involved in the B.HOME project, is a good example of this on a societal level.

To promote the widespread availability of educational resources in synthetic biology and related interdisciplinary fields, under the call of Fudan iGEM 2023, iGEM teams from universities in the Yangtze River Delta region formed [the Yangtze River Delta iGEM Alliance](/education/#review-and-further-dialogue-7).  Through the dedicated efforts of every iGEMers, we spread our efforts from the Yangtze River Delta to the entire country gradually, fully understanding differences in educational levels between regions through activities such as distributing surveys and hosting luncheon party. Subsequently, we conducted corresponding activities based on the educational characteristics of different regions and age groups (looking our [Education](/education/) for more details).

Through our efforts, we could attempt to minimize the negative impact of educational resource inequalities between regions, allowing everyone to have the opportunity to enjoy diverse interest courses. Furthermore, we expect that the Yangtze River Delta iGEM Alliance can shoulder the great mission of spreading synthetic biology and continually expand its influence in the future, spreading the charm of science to more people.

## SDG13 Climate Action & SDG15 Life on Land

An important part of the climate crisis is global warming, and one of the significant factors contributing to global warming is the damage to terrestrial ecosystems. Lichens, as a crucial component of ecosystem primary succession, also play a vital role in the regeneration and restoration of terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, although the primary goal of the B.HOME project is to achieve  the terraforming of terrestrial planet and create a second home for humans, it doesn’t mean that the biofilm we have developed isn’t applicable to Earth's environment. On the contrary, we firmly believe that this biofilm can excel in desert management, sand fixation, and soil stabilization.

In interviews with Dr. Jingwei Zhang from the School of Life Sciences at Fudan University, our ideas have been recognized and further supplemented (looking our [Human Practices](/human-practices/#dr-jingwei-zhang-a-unique-view-in-the-industry-of-synthetic-biology) for more details). In our conception, on one hand, the biofilm we engineered can **accelerate the primary succession of ecosystems** in hostile environments to mitigate the negative impacts of excessive industrialization on human society. On the other hand, compared to traditional lichens, this biofilm has **stronger survival capabilities**, making it less likely to perish in extreme environments. We consider that this biofilm can play a positive role in the recovery of terrestrial ecosystems and mitigate the greenhouse effect on Earth through vegetation regeneration.

Furthermore, in our activities, we emphasize repeatedly the concept that "**seeking a second home doesn’t mean ignoring the destruction of Earth"**, which has been a consensus among team members. B.HOME isn’t only a pioneer in lighting the torch of life on another planet like Prometheus, but also an implementer of protecting terrestrial ecosystems and addressing the climate crisis. Through this project, we expect that the audience can think more deeply about the dialectical relationship between humans, Earth, and space, enhance their awareness of SDGs-related concepts, and put them into practice.
