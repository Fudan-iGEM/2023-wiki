## With CAU-China: Project Design

In an interview with Prof. Yan Li, we explored organic acids' role in Earth's weathering. We plan to engineer *E. coli* for oxalic acid production, seeking solutions for altering metabolic pathways while safeguarding *E. coli*'s survival. Therefore, we had extensive online discussions with CAU-China_2023, with expertise in this area, regarding the feasibility and operational details of the oxalate module. They suggested heterologous expression of *obcA* and *obcB* genes under a single promoter and the addition of FpOAR to enhance *E. coli*'s viability in the presence of oxalic acid. We've now finalized our oxalic acid production genetic circuit(see more details in [Design](/design/)) in collaboration with CAU-China_2023.

## With ShanghaiTech-China & XMU-China: Wet Lab

Team ShanghaiTech-China_2023 provided us with plasmids containing the *SacC* and *CscB* genes, as well as a strain of cyanobacteria. This greatly facilitated our molecular cloning experiments and bacterial cultures. What's more, XMU-China_2022 contributed to the sequence for INPNC, which was a significant help in our plasmid construction. We are very grateful for their assistance in our wet lab experiments.

## With SCUT-China & NJU-China: Software Discussion

Our [software](/software/) aims to assist more teams in optimizing sequence design, so we have engaged in online discussions with several universities. We collaborated with NJU-China_2023 to enhance the user interface, making it more user-friendly with improved visualizations. Furthermore, we discussed with SCUT-China_2023 about using the software for wet lab experiment sequence design, exchanging project ideas and thoroughly understanding their requirements to provide personalized recommendations.

## With FDIS & THIS DL: Passing on our experience

Fudan International School(FDIS) and Tsinghua International School, Daoxiang Lake(THIS DL) have shown great enthusiasm for the iGEM competition and plan to establish teams in the next two years. Therefore, we engaged in several online and offline activities with students from these two schools who are interested in synthetic biology. We introduced them to the basics of synthetic biology and provided them with many ideas and suggestions for team establishment.

## With ShanghaiTech-China & Tongji-China & NUDT-China: Education Activities

To expand the reach and quality of our educational initiatives, we have collaborated with multiple universities on picture book projects, including ShanghaiTech-China_2023, Tongji-China_2023, and NUDT-China_2023. Our aim is to make synthetic biology more accessible to a broader audience through engaging visual storytelling and simplifying complex concepts. Each university has made significant contributions to the design, illustration, and printing of these picture books.

In addition, we have partnered with ShanghaiTech-China_2023 for further educational activities, such as exchange programs with FDIS (See more details in [Education](/education/#feed-curious-minds)).

## With Shanghai Natural History Museum & Shanghai Astronomy Museum: Event Organizer

During the summer vacation, we organized a series of high-quality educational activities, which would not have been possible without the invaluable support of the Shanghai Natural History Museum and the Shanghai Astronomy Museum as our activity partners. With the Shanghai Natural History Museum, we arranged internship researcher programs for high school students, which provided us with photographers and assisted in recruiting nine participants for our activities. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Shanghai Astronomy Museum, we conducted lectures and family-friendly events, introducing elementary school students aged 6-9 to the realms of biology and astronomy. What's more, we ignited their interest in science through do-it-yourself (DIY) games(See more details in [Education](/education/#feed-curious-minds)).
