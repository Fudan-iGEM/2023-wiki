### Improved Ribozyme-Assisted Polycistronic co-expression(pRAP) System

The use of ribozymes can help us regulate the expression of genes, but it may also pose a risk of mRNA instability. Therefore, in our part design, we have incorporated a stem-loop structure at the 3' end of the sequence, as shown below.

| Part Name                                                    | Type | Description                                             | Designer     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| [BBa_K4765020](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4765020) | RNA  | Twister P1 ribozyme, from 10.1080/15476286.2022.2123640 | Siliang Zhan |
| [BBa_K4765021](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4765021) | RNA  | stem-loop 1, from 10.1021/acssynbio.2c00416             | Siliang Zhan |
| [BBa_K4765024](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4765024) | RNA  | stem-loop 2                                             | Siliang Zhan |
| [BBa_K4765119](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4765119) | DNA  | ribozyme test: constitutive expression                  | Siliang Zhan |
| [BBa_K4765120](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4765120) | DNA  | ribozyme test: T7 leaky expression                      | Siliang Zhan |
| [BBa_K4765129](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4765129) | DNA  | stem-loop test                                          | Siliang Zhan |
| [BBa_K4765130](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4765130) | DNA  | shuttle test                                            | Siliang Zhan |

The expected benefit of the stem-loop structure is to enhance mRNA stability, thereby expanding the applicability of the ribozyme system. We hope other teams can incorporate such designs into their projects to effectively control gene expression efficiency.

## Alliance establishment and series of co-created picture books

This year, our dedicated efforts aimed to demystify synthetic biology and ignite a true enthusiasm for the field among all individuals. Through customized, engaging, and informative educational programs, we fostered **a productive two-way dialogue** with the public, enhancing the overall understanding of synthetic biology. This encouraged greater involvement and participation in shaping and contributing to the field, **setting a solid groundwork for future synthetic biology education**. For more details, please visit our [Education](/education/#empower-igem-community) wiki.

Leveraging the power of collaboration, we took the initiative to establish [the iGEM Alliance of the Yangtze River Delta](/education/#empower-igem-community), comprising iGEM teams from ShanghaiTech University, Tongji University, Zhejiang University, Nanjing University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The alliance represents a unified regional community dedicated to advancing synthetic biology and several teams in the alliance have collaboratively crafted **a series of educational picture books** this year, which can be **sustainable materials for future teams to carry out educational activities**. With our collective endeavors, we hold a confident vision that the iGEM Alliance of the Yangtze River Delta will be constantly developed by the iGEM teams and will etch a profound and enduring mark on the landscape of synthetic biology in China and beyond in the future.

## New multifunctional software tool: RAP

Based on software from Fudan iGEM 2022, we have made improvements to address some shortcomings and have added new features, leading to the creation of our new software tool, RAP.

RAP consists of three main components. Within the [KineticHub](/software/#kinetichub), with the assistance of the BRENDA database, we can calculate the optimal enzyme concentrations. With [Parthub 2](/software/#parthub-2), we can retrieve the required parts and download their sequences in GeneBank format. Finally, with the help of [RAP Builder](/#rap-builder), we can design the corresponding RBS and stem loop sequences by combining the results from KineticHub and the sequences from Parthub 2.

This software is designed to assist iGEMers and other researchers in **quickly finding part sequences, determining the optimal enzyme concentration ratios in their systems, and designing the appropriate RBS and stem-loop sequences**. This greatly **streamlines the process for users navigating the DBTL (Design-Build-Test-Learn) cycle**, while also contributing to the continued growth of RAP, making it even more beneficial for synthetic biology researchers in part design.
