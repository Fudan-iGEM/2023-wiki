## Overview

Through our [HP work](https://2023.igem.wiki/fudan/human-practices/), we've observed success in applying biotechnology to space exploration and the immense potential in merging synthetic biology and astronomy. Considering the need to enhance public awareness of synthetic biology in China, we've decided to focus on **"the application and potential of synthetic biology"**. We'd like to lead our audience into the fancy world of synthetic biology through **targeted, engaging, and constructive** education.

### The public survey

For "High-Quality Education", we surveyed over 400 participants, spanning various demographics. Statistical analysis reveals preferred educational activities by age groups, represented as bubbles where size indicates preference ratio(shown below). Detailed data for children and the general public can be found [here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4765/wiki/education/detailed-result-of-questionaires-for-public-survey-the-general-public.pdf). Due to insufficient data for those aged 30-60, our educational efforts primarily targeted people under 30.

### The "FIRE"

Based on the aforementioned findings, we've devised **4 key educational initiatives**:

- [**Feed Curious Minds:**](#feed-curious-minds) We've **created a series of picture books** for kids, **volunteered to teach** children in rural areas, and **established an impressive two-way dialogue** with students in FDIS.
- [**Interactive Biological Exploration:**](#interactive-biological-exploration) We cooperated with the **Shanghai Natural History Museum** and **Shanghai Astronomy Museum** to carry out high-quality activities including **Lab Experience Day** and **DIY workshops**.
- [**Reach the Public:**](#reach-the-public) With **a metaverse game** and **street interviews**, we've brought synthetic biology to the general public. Besides, we've **provided a multidisciplinary collision insight** into the future of synthetic biology.
- [**Empower the iGEM Community:**](#empower-igem-community) In celebration of **iGEM's 20th anniversary**, we made multiple attempts to expand the community of synthetic biology enthusiasts within **Fudan University**, **educational enterprises**, and **the Yangtze River Delta**.

Collectively, these initiatives embody "FIRE". We hope that the "FIRE" will be perpetuated by more and more people, sparking a wildfire of synthetic biology enthusiasm—much like Prometheus ignited mankind's spirit.

| **Participants** | Zhe Dong, Chenye Li, Yijun Wang, Qingying Yang, Mingfang Zheng |
| **Audience**     | Children aged 4-7                                            |

***"A truly excellent children's book is not just for children but also for the child within every adult."***

We were committed to making science education accessible to more children, providing them with a fascinating world of synthetic biology. So we **initiated a collaboration** among four iGEM teams (Fudan; ShanghaiTech; Tongji; and NUDT) to create a picture book series centered on **genes and gene editing**. We carefully balanced **professionalism** with **accessibility** and incorporated **interactive** **elements** to create an immersive reading experience and encourage active participation in learning synthetic biology. Through **continuous feedback** from a children's book editor and a select group of children, we refined the series constantly. And we've freely distributed these books nationwide both offline and online.

<iframe src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4765/wiki/education/picture-book-gene-editing.pdf" width="100%" height='500px'></iframe>


Considering children's reading habits, we focused on creating picture books with engaging content and concise text. We also took the advice of an editor from **"Same As Child"** (a famous children's picture book publishing house in China), selecting essential concepts in the field of synthetic biology, using simplified expressions and valid examples, and incorporating visualizations to achieve a good educational effect.

In the two books **"What Are Genes"** and **"Gene Editing"**, a magician leads two children through time and space. They journey with Mendel to learn about genes and then explore gene editing and the applications of synthetic biology in modern times. We also addressed ethical dimensions, reminding children of respect for life and a cautious approach to science and technology.

#### **Review and Further Dialogue**

Upon completing initial drafts, we asked professional editors for advice. On Sep. 26th, we reached out to the editor from "Same As Child" for **a second round of feedback**, involving ShanghaiTech and Tongji teams. Based on the editor's suggestions, we optimized the font size, layout, and text. In addition, we also printed out a small number of the first edition to select children, including team members' siblings and primary school students in Shanghai and in rural areas.

Besides, We invited some children to our reading activities and led them to read our picture books, guiding them to think about the questions and complete the interactive tasks like drawing in the picture books. In this way, we've not only promoted synthetic biology by spreading our books but also got authentic feedback from children to improve our books constantly.

#### **Review and Further Dialogue**

At CCiC, we witnessed the growth of synthetic biology in China. To strengthen inter-regional cooperation, we spearheaded the creation of **the iGEM Alliance of the Yangtze River Delta**. Leading universities, including ShanghaiTech, TJU, ZJU, NJU, and SJTU, joined forces to form the core regional community to advance synthetic biology. We've also sought support from **the Shanghai Society of Genetics**. We're confident that the iGEM Alliance of the Yangtze River Delta will make a significant impact in the future.
