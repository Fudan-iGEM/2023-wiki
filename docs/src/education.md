In partnership with the Ministry of Education's Gene Technology Engineering Research Center, we hosted a **summer camp** for high school students, introducing them to synthetic biology. Starting with the central dogma, we used analogies like cells as factories, organelles as workshops, and enzymes as workers for a visual explanation. We also encouraged students to share their insights on synthetic biology and its applications.

**Review:**  Upon consulting the high school instructor, we received **valuable advice to simplify terminology**, include more diagrams, and incorporate interactive games for student engagement. This feedback underscores the importance of balancing educational content with interactive and enjoyable elements in our future programs.
