## Overview

From the moment Shenzhou V successfully launched, the dream of exploring space is no longer out of reach for people in China. In the past decade, a stream of popular science animations, space documentaries, science fiction films, and planetariums have revealed to the public the mysteries of the universe. Nowadays, with the worsening environmental problems such as global warming, space immigration has gradually become a hot topic, especially among the Millennials.

Through our <u>HP work</u>, we noticed that many attempts to apply biology technology to space exploration have proved successful in the past few years and that there are vast possibilities for combining synthetic biology and space exploration. Considering that public awareness of synthetic biology in China remains to be improved, this year we decided to focus our education on **"the application and possibilities of synthetic biology"**. We'd like to lead our audience into the fancy world of synthetic biology through **more well-targeted, interesting, and constructive** education.

### The public survey

To achieve "High-Quality Education", a questionnaire survey was conducted with over 400 random samples ranging in age, gender, job, and cultural background. Statistical analysis shows the form of educational activities preferred by people of different ages(shown below). The size of bubbles refers to the ratio of people who prefer a certain activity in his/her age group. All the original data and primary statistics for children or for [the general public]([detailed-result-of-questionaires-for-public-survey-the-general-public.pdf (igem.wiki)](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4765/wiki/education/detailed-result-of-questionaires-for-public-survey-the-general-public.pdf)) are available. Since the sample capacity of people aged 30~60 is not enough for a reliable conclusion, we mainly focus our education work on people under 30.

### The "FIRE"

Based on the results above, we map out **4 main lines** in our education work:

- **Feed Curious Minds**: To arouse the audience's interest in synthetic biology, we **created a series of picture books** for kids, **volunteered to teach** children in rural areas, and **established an impressive two-way dialogue** with students in FDIS.
- **Interactive Biological Exploration**: This year, we cooperate with the  **Shanghai Natural History Museum** and the **Shanghai Astronomy Museum** to carry out more quality educational activities such as **lab experience** and **DIY workshops**.
- **Reach the Public**: With **a metaverse game** and **street interviews**, we bring synthetic biology to the view of the general public. Besides, we **offered a multidisciplinary collision insight** into the future development of synthetic biology.
- **Empower the iGEM Community**: On the 20th anniversary of the iGEM competition, we made multiple attempts to build a  larger community of synthetic biology lovers in **Fudan University**, **educational businesses**, and **the Yangtze River Delta**.

Altogether, our education activities form the "FIRE", symbolizing our effort to ignite the audience's interest in synthetic biology. More importantly, we sincerely hope that the "FIRE" can be passed on by both Fudan iGEMers and our audience so that the passion for synthetic biology will spread like wildfire——just like Prometheus gave mankind the kindling.

***"A truly excellent children's book is not just for children but also for the child within every adult."***

Our mission was to expand science education to reach a broader audience of children, providing them with the opportunity to explore the fascinating world of synthetic biology.  To achieve this, we **initiated a collaboration** among four iGEM teams (Fudan; ShanghaiTech; Tongji; NUDT) to create an engaging science picture book series focused on **genes and gene editing**. We carefully balanced **professionalism** with **accessibility** by incorporating many **interactive** **elements** to create an immersive experience. Through **continuous feedback** from a children's book editor and a small group of children, we refined our series. Leveraging the iGEM platform, we have freely distributed these books both offline and online.

Our goal is to nurture the innocence of children, transform intricate scientific knowledge into enjoyable experiences, and inspire children to actively explore the fascinating world of synthetic biology.

**Preliminary Research: Shaping Format and Topics**

Before outlining our picture books, we conducted interviews with students who had younger siblings to gain insights into the reading habits of young children aged 4-7. We discovered that children are easily distracted while reading, leading us to focus on creating picture books with engaging content, fewer pages, and concise text. We also consulted professional editors for topic selection. The editor from **"Same As Child"**, a publishing house dedicated to popularizing arts and science through picture books, recommended selecting essential synthetic biology concepts, using valid examples, and incorporating visualizations to make abstract content tangible for children.

【four logos + tongleiren】

**Storyline Creation: Balancing Professionalism and Accessibility**

In the two books **"What Are Genes"** and **"Gene Editing"**, a magician leads two children through time and space. They explore with Mendel to learn about genes and then return to modern times to delve into gene editing and the applications of synthetic biology. In addition to the biological content, we also address ethical dimensions, educating children to respect all forms of life and raising awareness of the ethical aspects of gene editing.

Following the storyline creation, we meticulously reviewed and modified the script to ensure scientific accuracy. We also emphasized the importance of accessibility by using simplified expressions and valid examples, enabling children to grasp key synthetic biology concepts.

**Illustration: Blending the Gap between Abstract and Engaging**

Transforming **abstract concepts** into **vivid images** presented a challenging but pivotal step in the book creation process.

To provide children with an aesthetically pleasing reading experience, we opted for vibrant colors, soft and smooth fonts, and emphasized and enlarged key terms. Different fonts were used for dialogues and narration to enhance readability.

The illustrations were enriched with **interactive elements** to engage children in the reading process. Our aim was to create an enjoyable and immersive experience where children not only gain knowledge but also participate actively in thinking and doing, enhancing the overall fun and engagement of understanding biology.

#### **Review and Further Dialogue**

After completing our initial picture book drafts, we sought feedback from professional children's picture book editors. On September 26th, we reached out to the editor of "Same As Child" for **a second round of feedback**, this time involving the ShanghaiTech and Tongji teams. The editors acknowledged the picture books for their strong interactivity while also sharing professionally published children's books and offering valuable suggestions for improvement:

1. **Font Size:** Adjust text size smaller to avoid crowded pages.
2. **Layout:** Maintain consistent spacing between lines in both books for a more polished appearance.
3. **Spacing:** Streamline the text to avoid page imbalances and keep the content engaging.
4. **Simplification:** Less text with the text spread out to avoid page imbalance

Based on these suggestions, we diligently revised the books, had them printed, and distributed them to children across the country.



### Continuous Dialogue: Communication with FDIS

Fudan International School (FDIS) is a branch school affiliated to Fudan University. As a first-class senior high school in China, FDIS aims to promote mutual exchange among students from different countries and cultivate outstanding international talents. Since an increasing number of students in FDIS have shown interest in synthetic biology, we established continuous and impressive two-way dialogue with them. We will foster their interest and encourage them to participate in the iGEM 2024 competition.

We gave a brief lecture on the topic of *Unlocking the Mysteries of Synthetic Biology: Exploring the iGEM Competition*. During the lecture, we introduced synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, viewed some excellent work by high school iGEM teams, and shared our personal experiences on participating in the competition. Our intention is to encourage them to enjoy the whole process of iGEM, instead of just working for the awards.

**Review:** After the lecture, we got a lot of feedback through questionnaires after the lecture. Most of the audience gained a general understanding of iGEM and were greatly interested in synthetic biology. To satisfy their curiosity, we held a follow-up open house activity which included campus visiting, artwork crafting, and interactive workshops.

After the lecture, we recruited some students who showed strong interest in our follow-up open house activity. In order to provide them with a more comprehensive understanding of the iGEM competition, we invited other iGEM teams,  ShanghaiTech-China 2023, XJTLU-CHINA 2023, and Fudan 2022, to the activity. The activity involves:

- **A visit to Tan Jiazhen Memorial Hall:** Mr. Tan is a famous biologist who founded the first school of life sciences in China. We hoped that the high school students could regard him as a role model and learn from his patriotism and scientific spirit.
- **A buffet in the canteen:**  Both the iGEMers and high school students were invited to the buffet, during which they freely discussed the development of synthetic biology and fancy ideas for iGEM projects.
- **An interactive workshop:** The course is designed and held by Fudan and assisted by other iGEM teams. Firstly, each iGEM team introduced their projects to high school students. Then, we offered an inverted course, including a brief introduction to gene circuits and literature retrieval methods. Finally, we taught the students the basic structure of DNA by crafting an origami artwork.

#### **Review and Further Dialogue**

This open house activity has achieved a good educational result. We gave interesting questions about the Cre-loxP system after introducing the gene circuit. We set up three questions in total, with their difficulty increasing step by step. The high school students were enthusiastic and most of them successfully solved the first two and a few solved all the questions. After that, many students hoped to participate in our activities again in the future and we kept in touch with them. Other iGEM teams also spoke highly of our open house activity.

### Education Volunteering for Rural Area

Fudan iGEM 2023 has done a lot of work to popularize public education in the fields of synthetic biology, environmental science, and astronomy in China. We believe that it is very important to promote knowledge to children of different ages from different regions of China, especially those from relatively underdeveloped regions. Therefore, providing educational resources to remote areas is one of the focuses of the education part of our project this year.

With the principle of "adjusting measures to local conditions", we designed various courses and activities for children with varying levels of knowledge. Through a series of activities, we aimed to help children learn about synthetic biology, stimulate their enthusiasm for life science and space exploration, and cultivate their scientific spirits.

When considering strategies for educational activities for middle school students at Shizuishan Experimental High School, we noticed that although the educational resources in this region are significantly behind the national average, it possesses abundant astronomical natural resources. Therefore, we plan to utilize this resource and collaborate with the Fudan University Astronomy Association to organize an astronomy and biology science summer camp called the "Tianwen Program".

During this one-week science summer camp, we conducted three on-site stargazing activities to show children the vastness and wonder of the universe. Building upon this, we demonstrated the basic principles of synthetic biology and used this year's Fudan iGEM project as an example to guide the children in thinking about the possibilities of using synthetic biology to advance space exploration.

**Review:** This event also made us realize the potential for interdisciplinary interactions between synthetic biology and other fields. We believe that synthetic biology is not an isolated discipline, and it is only by strengthening the exchange between synthetic biology and other disciplines that its fascinating aspects can be seen by more people.

After the "Tianwen" program, we decided to shift our focus towards more vulnerable communities to achieve a more comprehensive education outreach. As a result, we collaborated with Fudan University's Colorful Cloud Association to provide an online science education on synthetic biology and astronomy to the left-behind children in Suining, Sichuan Province.

The core of this science outreach class was to introduce two essential concepts to the children - terraforming on Mars and synthetic biology. We presented the knowledge of synthetic biology within a space context, inspiring the children to consider the potential role of synthetic biology in space exploration.

**Review:** Due to the lack of educational resources, the children had limited knowledge in the field of biology. However, during this teaching process, we keenly felt their strong interest in synthetic biology and space exploration. This made us realize the importance of understanding the educational backgrounds of the learners in ensuring the quality of the teaching.

In order to further promote synthetic biology, we participated in education volunteering for rural regions organized by the Department of Materials Science at Fudan University, focusing on Yongping County Siyuan Experimental School.

Yongping County is a multi-ethnic town located on the southwestern border of China with a rich poetry culture. During our research, we noticed that the creative process of poetry and the underlying logic of genetic circuit design in synthetic biology share similarities. Poets often use the combination of imagery to depict scenes and express emotions, while synthetic biologists are accustomed to using combinations of genetic components to make engineered organisms functional.

Therefore, before formally teaching the curriculum, we designed an activity called "Creating Collage Poems" to help elementary school students better understand the fundamental logic of synthetic biology. Under the guidance of our team members, the students successfully created beautiful and playful poems by using fragments of imagery and basic connecting words. What surprised us was that after completing the "Creating Collage Poems" activity, the students' efficiency in acquiring knowledge significantly improved, indicating the success of our previous curriculum design.

**Review:** This series of outreach teaching activities made us realize that the relation of synthetic biology with other disciplines is not just a relationship between production techniques and application areas. We need to focus on deeper correlations, such as underlying logic, fundamental framework construction and so on.

We collaborated with Fudan University's Expedition Community to deliver a science outreach lesson on synthetic biology to the ethnic minority students in Hainan Province. This educational activity focused on a minority group that had been previously overlooked, serving as a significant complement to our education activities.

The main theme of this course was to guide the students in addressing two questions: What is synthetic biology, and what can be done using synthetic biology? To provide a clear and detailed explanation of synthetic biology, we included discussions on topics such as DNA structure and function, central dogma, and gene editing techniques.

**Review:** After the class, we distributed creative souvenirs from iGEM (such as badges), and most of the students displayed a strong interest in synthetic biology and iGEM. Many of them also wrote their post-class reflections, expressing how useful they found synthetic biology, and some even shared their ideas and expectations for the future applications of synthetic biology.

On the basis of summarizing the previous activities' experiences, we decided to organize a synthetic biology-themed science popularization seminar for the fourth-grade students at the school after gaining initial insights into the education of young children in Cangnan County,

During the formal teaching session, we started by discussing individual trait differences, a concept familiar to the students,  and explained the relationship between genes and traits. Additionally, we invited the students to brainstorm and design their "own synthetic biology projects" using simple graphics and text and encouraged them to present and discuss their ideas.

**Review:** Many of the creative ideas shared by the students inspired team members, allowing us to view the project from a fresh perspective. Education is a mutual learning process that enables both to make progress.

After the workshop, a lecture on lab safety was arranged to ensure that all the students would take responsibility for the safety of themselves, their peers, and the in/off-lab environment(see details in Safety). A safety guarantee letter was signed voluntarily before any lab experience activities.

With the permission of their parents, we invited all the students to our studio and offered them an opportunity to analyze their DNA fingerprints, the VNTR sequence called DIS80 on the 1st human chromosome. The experiment was designed by our team members on account of its interest, operability, safety, and reproducibility. During the process, students learned the principles, SOP, and troubleshooting experience of basic techniques in synthetic biology such as PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. With great effort, most of them received an ideal result and an unforgettable experience.

To provide a more vivid and concrete understanding of synthetic biology, we collaborated with the group "Promise`<Pending>`", whose leader is an iGEMer in 2021 and 2022 (Group members: Shitao Gong, Gengyu Wang, Jiayi Wang, Shangxuan Tang), to jointly develop a metaverse game about synthetic biology. This game showcases the magical effects and vast potential applications of synthetic biology, especially in the exciting field of space exploration.

The setting of this game takes place thousands of years in the future when Earth's resources are on the brink of depletion. In response, people have sent a multitude of robots to other planets to create environments suitable for human habitation, which aligns with our project design for this year. In the game, players are tasked with controlling robots to search for scattered "parts", construct gene circuits, and complete corresponding exploration missions.

#### Review and Further Dialogue:

In previous questionnaires, we found that the majority of visitors who had heard of synthetic biology had a positive attitude toward it. Specifically, 73.17% believe that synthetic biology has advantages and disadvantages, but the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Some 96.67% agreed that "synthetic biotechnology has risks, but is generally beneficial and should be developed". To gain a more detailed idea of the public awareness of synthetic biology, we took to the streets and interviewed random people.

To find out how much the public knows about synthetic biology, we conducted street interviews. In this encounter, we met predecessors engaged in bio-pharmaceutical, international friends from Australia, and senior students from other universities in Shanghai. We had discussions with them. We briefly introduced our project, listened to their ideas, and explored with them the broad prospects of synthetic biology in a variety of fields  (Figure 1).

 **Synthetic biology is a new technological route**

The seniors told us that synthetic biology is very widely used in the pharmaceutical field and was once recognized by the capital. However, due to technological limitations, although it is feasible at the laboratory level, it has never been able to be put into mass production, so the development of synthetic biology pharmaceuticals is still limited. However, our predecessors are still positive about synthetic biology and consider it "a new technology route" .

**Synthetic biology can be of benefit to mankind if it is used well**

On the day of the interview, we also met international friends from Australia. Through communication with them, we learned that although they were engaged in finance-related professions, they also had a certain understanding of synthetic biology. When it comes to their attitude towards synthetic biology, they think it depends on the situation, in their eyes, "it could be good if it is used for the right purposes." "it is good as long as done ethically."

**A curious connection between building genetic circuits and building foundations**

In the process of interviewing on the street, we met the first-year seniors from Shanghai Donghua University. Although they do not know much about biology after studying civil engineering, they understand the significance of building genetic circuits with our simple explanation. "Building a genetic circuit is kind of like building a foundation," one of the seniors told us. "Each part of the gene is like a brick," he says. Although the professional direction is different, everyone has their own understanding of synthetic biology.

[分别采访天文馆、哲学、生物学等不同领域的老师，看不同领域对合成生物学的未来的看法]




## Empower iGEM community

The year 2023 is the 20th anniversary of the iGEM competition. As a senior participant, Fudan iGEM has brought together numerous synthetic biology lovers and has set up the Bertalanffy club to call on more college students to explore the fancy world of synthetic biology. In memory of this special event, we'd like to build a wide relationship with synthetic biology lovers in the Yangtze River Delta, thus empowering the iGEM community.

### The Bertalanffy Club:  Synthetic Biology Lovers at Fudan

The Bertalanffy Club, established in 2011, has already been a warm community for synthetic biology lovers at Fudan University. As a senior student club, the Bertalanffy Club has two annual activities, the campus fair and the winter camping. Through the campus fair, we attract synthetic biology lovers to join our community, while through winter camping, we cultivate new Fudan iGEMers. Like the alternation of generation, these activities allow our team community to continuously inherit and develop.

During ten-day training, members of the Bertalanffy Club received an extensive understanding of both theoretical knowledge and experimental skills of synthetic biology. With the guidance of former Fudan iGEMers, those who were willing to participate in iGEM 2023 formed small groups, learned from excellent iGEM projects, and brainstormed their own ideas. Every group underwent three rounds of project PK to continually improve their projects. A final presentation is arranged to select our team members. The new Fudan iGEMers would receive extra training in lab safety after the winter camping.

The Campus Fair, known as the "Great Battle of a Hundred Regiments"  is one of the most distinctive activities for students at Fudan University. Annually, numerous clubs participate in the carnival and offer innovative activities to recruit new members. On behalf of the Bertalanffy Club, we organized multiple synthetic-biology-related activities at the Campus Fair 2023:

- Flyers were distributed to promote the Synthetic Biology and iGEM competitions (click to view attachment: flyer.pdf).

- Students could DIY their own ballrooms with elements of synthetic biology, assemble a functional genetic circuit with a genetic component puzzle, and particapte in a knowlegde quiz. Those who did an excellent work would receive exquisite gifts.

- Two origami models of DNA (with left and right-hand spirals) were available, and participants could obtain a commemorative badge by choosing a common DNA shape and completing the origami.

**Review:** The campus fair was a resounding success, with everyone enjoying themselves. Students holding our balloons could be seen everywhere on the campus. This achievement demonstrated that souvenirs and engaging activities can effectively spark interest in synthetic biology and promote the subject.

#### Review and Further Dialogue

Through a series of synthetic biology-related activities held by the Bertalanffy Club, we found that students from disciplines more intertwined with biology (e.g. chemistry, medicine) showed great interest in synthetic biology.  The number of people following our official WeChat account has soared after the campus fair. However, further efforts should be made to involve students interested in humanities and commerce.

| **Audience**     | High school students                            |

We collaborated with the Engineering Research Center of the Ministry of Education for Gene Technology to organize a summer camp for senior high school students to popularize synthetic biology. Since our audience was relatively new to biology, we began with the central dogma, then compared the cell to a factory, organelles to workshops, and enzymes to hardworking workers, providing a vivid and visual definition of synthetic biology. After that, we encouraged the children to share their understanding of synthetic biology and its applications.

**Review:**  We sought feedback and suggestions from the instructor leading the high school students. She suggested we incorporate simpler terms, add more schematic diagrams, and include interactive and entertaining games to captivate the children's attention. After the communication, we recognize the need to strike a balance between challenging content and engaging fun in our future science education programs.

**Review:** Through this symposium, we found that the current Chinese education system failed to bridge the gap between high school education and university major choices. Many high school students interested in synthetic biology found it difficult to access relevant educational resources and professional information. This might be one of the weak links that iGEM teams could work on to improve within the education chain.

**Our partners:**

- **THIS DL (Tsinghua International School, Daoxiang Lake)** is a renowned international high school located in the Haidian District, Peking, which has upheld the educational philosophy of combining Chinese basic education with international education.

- **LabXcel** is an educational company committed to inspiring and nurturing scientific thinking, exploratory spirit, and future-oriented adaptability in young people. It has been eager to help students at THIS DL, who are interested in synthetic biology, to participate in the iGEM competition to enhance their research abilities and international perspectives. This totally aligns with the pursuit of our education work.

To attract more students to participate in the iGEM competition, we held a lecture at THIS DL with the topic of *Exploring Microbial Design, Integrating Multidisciplinary Talents*. We believe that the iGEM competition involves a series of interdisciplinary activities centered around synthetic biology. Therefore, it is important to encourage students interested in non-biological fields such as programming, business, or graphic design to join the competition and to share their opinions.

During the lecture, our team members introduced the basic competition format of iGEM and provided some popular science concepts in synthetic biology to students from THIS DL. In addition, team members combined outstanding cases of high school iGEM teams to demonstrate the multifaceted assessment of team members' abilities in iGEM. Accordingly, we called on students interested in non-biological fields to participate in the iGEM competition<u>(click here for more details)</u>.

#### Review and Further Dialogue

In the Q&A session, we listened to a thoughtful student's project idea - "Soil Cadmium Ion Content Determination Technology Based on Plant Gene Editing" - and exchanged suggestions regarding project modeling. Additionally, we helped students interested in graphic design, human practices, and other areas to better understand the iGEM competition. Through these interactions, we were able to examine our project design from a new perspective and gain some new insights.

After the lecture, we discussed some questions about iGEM with teachers from LabXcel and THIS DL. We also provided audio science popularization materials related to synthetic biology made by our team as learning materials for THIS DL. Through communication with professionals from both businesses and schools, we learned new educational philosophies and ideas, which we hope to apply in the preparation work of Fudan iGEM next year.

The Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) was an annual national communication meeting independently initiated by Chinese iGEM teams, which provides a resource-sharing and mutual learning platform for iGEM teams and synthetic biology lovers. This year, Fudan iGEM 2023 attended the 10th CCiC and established impressive communications

- **Presentation:** We shared our project with other teams through posters and presentations. Our project is based on the background of space migration. We took inspiration from the primary succession on the Earth, hoping to design an ecological biofilm that can be programmed and transformed to adapt to the alien environment and perform functions similar to lichen.
- **Lectures:** We participated in several academic lectures and listened to the special reports of many experts from universities and institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
- **Cooperation:** Communicating with teams from all over the country, we received some constructive comments and suggestions on our project, especially on the method of genetic editing on cyanobacteria.

### Review and Further Dialogue

During CCiC, we found that synthetic biology has become increasingly popular in China. To attract more people from different fields to participate in the future development of synthetic biology, we led and initiated the establishment of the iGEM Alliance of the Yangtze River Delta. The idea has won the support of a series of prominent Chinese universities, such as ShanghaiTech, Tongji University, Zhejiang University, Nanjing University, and Shanghai Jiaotong University. Together we form the primary community of the regional association, making joint efforts to promote the development of synthetic biology. To fulfill our plan, we seek both academic and fanatical support from the Shanghai Society of Genetics. The administrator of SSG spoke highly of the association. We believe that the iGEM Alliance of the Yangtze River Delta would certainly make a difference.
