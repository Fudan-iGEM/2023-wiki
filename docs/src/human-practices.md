## Overview

This year, we made a bold attempt to explore outer space and target modifying the environment of terrestrial planets, which will **benefit all mankind** in the future. In contrast to our past work, it's extremely hard to determine all the stakeholders since our project will work for all humans. However, we still gave priority to human practice and successfully forged a bond with **space researchers**, **distinguished biologists**, and **specialists in Environmental Ethics**.

To get a comprehensive and unambiguous idea of the existing challenges, current situations, and future growth of our project, we mapped out **three main lines** in our HP work:

1.  [**Determining the Value**](#determining-the-value): In this part, we aimed to determine the current challenges and probabilities in space exploration. Through communication with **professors in astrobiology**, **leading experts in space exploration**, and **senior instructors in entrepreneurship**, we got a more detailed idea of the **academic**, **environmental**, **and commercial values** of our project.

2. [**Fulfilling the Plan**](#fulfilling-the-plan): In this part, we turned to **experts in soil ecosystems**, **specialists in microbe**, and **previous iGEM teams** to seek professional suggestions for our experimental design. With their assistance, we **developed a symbiotic system, functional system, and survival system** in our engineering bacteria.

3. [**Addressing the Risk**](#addressing-the-risk): In this part, we focused on the potential risks of our project, which would threaten the interests of all mankind. With the insight of **specialists in Environmental Ethics**, we were fully aware of **our duty to balance space exploration and environmental ethics.** We also searched for a reliable method to **address the safety issues.**

This year, all of our HP work follows **the STAR loop**(shown below).

## Determining the Value

### Prof. Yan Li: The Possibilities and Challenges for Life on Mars

<p style="font-size: 1rem">📅 Date: Jul. 15th  👤Participants: Zhe Dong, Xiaohan Jiang, Chenye Li, Qingying Yang</p>

**Stimulation**

In the early stage, we attempted to **build a symbiotic system** that resembles lichen with cyanobacteria and *E. Coli*. We assumed that this system enables engineered *E. Coli* to survive on the surface of terrestrial planets and to promote the progress of terraforming through its metabolites.  We wondered that:

1. Is there enough **essential substance** for life to survive existing on terrestrial planets?

2. What's the characteristic of the **environment** on the surface of terrestrial planets?

3. Is there any possibility to light the dawn of life on terrestrial planets?

**Target**

Prof. Li is now an associate professor and doctoral supervisor at the School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University, China. In the past ten years, she has done great research on the origin of life catalyzed by natural sulfide minerals and the interaction between microorganisms and minerals. Recently, she has been interested in the process of matter and energy cycling catalyzed by minerals on the surface of early Earth and Mars.

	</div>
</div>

**Action**

On account of distance and time, we interviewed Prof. Li online on July 15th. She described our project as **an interesting and daring innovation in the academic field** and was generous with professional advice. In response to our questions, she recommended **Mars** as the terrestrial planet with a high probability of life.  In her opinion:

1. Though nitrogen accounts for only 0.1% of the Martian atmosphere, it is enough to build a complete nitrogen cycle essential for life.
2. The water, mainly existing in the crystalline form on the surface of Mars,  lays the foundation for the existence of life.
3. So far, the soil of the moon which is far more infertile than Martian soil has proved to be capable of supporting life. The symbiotic system to promote the terraforming of Mars **is worth trying**.
4. Research has shown a potential association of vigorous minerals with life activity in harsh environments like highlands and deserts on Earth. Similar minerals have been found on Mars, indicating another probable condition for life.

Besides, Prof. Li pointed out the challenges for life to survive on the surface of Mars. For example, the environment, with huge temperature differences, intense radiation, and frequent storms, makes it extremely difficult to keep enough nutrients. The water in crystalline form can hardly be directly absorbed and used by creatures.  The lack of phosphorus will also be a key limiting factor for life.

Finally, Prof. Li reminds us of the heterogeneity of the Martian surface environment and the process of **biological weathering** on Earth. She encouraged us to imagine more possibilities and was glad to have further communication with us.

**Review**

With the insights of Prof. Li, we:

1. Take **Mars** as the representative of the terrestrial planet.
2. Involve an **anti-UV module** and an **anti-freeze module** in our engineered bacteria.

### Space Webinar: Synthetic Biology in Space

<p style="font-size: 1rem"> 📅 Date: Jul. 27th  👤Participants: All team members</p>

**Stimulation**

Although Prof. Li spoke highly of our project,  we remain concerned about the significance and acceptability of modifying the environment of terrestrial planets with biological techniques. We wondered that:

1. Are there any successful examples of applying biological techniques to space exploration?
2.  How will mankind on Earth benefit from our project in the short term?

**Target**

The iGEM Technology hosted a space webinar entitled *Synthetic Biology in Space: Achievements and Possibilities*. In collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), leading experts were invited to discuss the fascinating intersection of synthetic biology and space exploration and to elaborate on the challenges they had faced.

**Action**

On July 27th, our team members participated in the webinar and benefited a lot. In terms of previous iGEM projects, both Dr. Christiane Hahn and Dr. Rodrigo Coutinho de Almeida spoke highly of the **symbiotic system** consisting of yeast and cyanobacteria. Elaborating on the challenges, Dr. Christiane considered the survival of cells in the harsh environment of space as the first issue. As she mentioned, the ability to **resist cold, radiation, and drought** matters for biological samples to survive in space. Meanwhile, she reminded us that the achievements of space research might be applied to address problems on Earth.

**Review**

In the Q & A section, we shared our idea of developing a survival module in our engineering bacteria with multiple bio-bricks with the experts. Prof. Daniela Billi **found our idea very innovative and approved it**. This encouraged us to go further with our initial ideas. Besides, inspired by Dr. Christiane, we found our project **environmentally beneficial**. The symbiotic system we created would potentially help rebuild a delicate ecosystem on the barren lands of Earth, such as the Sahara desert.

### Dr. Jingwei Zhang: A Unique View in the Industry of Synthetic Biology

<p style="font-size: 1rem">📅 Date: Sep. 20th  👤Participants: Zhe Dong, Zhenmao Ye, Siliang Zhan</p>

**Stimulation**

Although our project has a great prospect, it will cost huge amounts of time and money to fulfill our plan. For the sustainable development of our project, it's necessary to gain support from the industry of synthetic biology. We wondered that:

1. How to promote the rapid development of the industry of synthetic biology?
2. Are there any **commercial values** related to our project？

**Target**

Dr. Zhang is now a young researcher at the School of Life Sciences, Fudan University. He is mainly engaged in the development and industrialization of droplet microfluidic systems. As a senior instructor in entrepreneurship, Mr. Zhang always offers his students extensive and innovative insights into the development of the biological industry.

	</div>
</div>

**Action**

We had lunch with Mr. Zhang and shared our opinions on the industry of synthetic biology. Mr. Zhang pointed out that the subjective agency of living creatures could potentially join hands with synthetic biology techniques. He believed that the combination of **human intelligence** and **the instinct of creatures** would further unleash the potential of synthetic biology.

In terms of our project, Mr. Zhang believed that its environmental benefits could bring about commercial values, just like the invention of new energy cars. What really matters is to **find a suitable application** so that the reward can overcome the cost.

**Review**

With the innovative insight of Dr. Jingwei Zhang, we **explored the commercial value** of our projects in multiple fields, such as agriculture, energy, and the cosmetic industry(see more details in <u>Implementation</u>). Besides, Dr. Zhang was quite interested in our project and kept up with our progress. [A follow-up](#follow-up-with-dr-jingwei-zhang-feasibility-of-a-suicide-switch) was taken with him about the safety concerns.




## Fulfilling the Plan


### Prof. Changming Fang: How to Build a Good Symbiotic System

<p style="font-size: 1rem">📅 Date: Jun. 1st  👤Participants: Zhe Dong, Zhenmao Ye</p>

**Simulation**

This year, we decided to build a symbiotic system that resembles lichen with cyanobacteria and *E. Coli*. However, our team members have little idea of lichen and no experience in building a symbiotic system before. We wondered that:

1. What's the function of bacteria and fungus in the symbiotic system of lichen?

2. How does lichen survive harsh environmental conditions like drought on Earth?

3. How can we adjust the radio of cyanobacteria and *E. Coli* in the system?

**Target**

Prof. Fang is a professor and doctoral supervisor at the School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, China. He has long been engaged in research on soil carbon and nitrogen cycles and their regulatory mechanisms, the impact of global climate change on soil ecosystem processes, and soil ecological models.

	<div>
		<p><small style="color: gray">Prof. Changming Fang</small></p>
	</div>
</div>

**Action**

We had a pleasant conversation with him about our symbiotic system design. Prof. Fang made a detailed explanation of the composition of lichen. Algae mainly **provide energy and essential substances like **saccharides** through photosynthesis while fungi provide the necessary ions for algae. Besides, fungi can maintain the **physical structure** of lichen by secreting **polysaccharides**. The physical structure is quite necessary for lichens, which equips them with a strong ability to absorb and keep water. With this ability, lichens can form sheet-like structures to keep water under dry conditions and quickly rejuvenate when adequate water is available.

Considering our experimental design, Prof. Fang pointed out huge challenges in engineering the symbiotic system of lichens. Since the structural paradigm of lichens has undergone a long evolutionary evolution, the delicate composition remains unknown to humans in many aspects. He recommended we build a physical structure to make our symbiotic system more tolerant of the environment. He also reminded us of **the association between physiological characteristics and the environment**.

**Review**

With the professional suggestions of Prof. Fang, we introduced **a cell-cell adhesion Module** into our symbiotic system. With this module, we could construct a **biofilm** with a programmable physical structure through antigen-nanobody interaction. The biofilm would contribute to the survival of our symbiotic system on the surface of Mars. (see more details in <u>Description</u>)

### Prof. Zhexue Quan: How to Make *E. Coli* Resistant to the Harsh Environment

<p style="font-size: 1rem">📅 Date: Jun. 4th  👤Participants: Zhe Dong, Zhenmao Ye, Siliang Zhan</p>

**Simulation**

Considering the harsh environment on the surface of terrestrial planets, we need to genetically engineer *E. Col*i so that our symbiotic system can survive for a long time. We wondered that:

1. How do some special microbes **survive the extreme environment**?
2. How can we **test** the survival ability of our engineered *E. Coli*?

**Target**

Prof. Quan is a professor and doctoral supervisor at the School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, China. He has long been engaged in research on the physiological and biochemical characteristics of comammox and its role in the ecosystem. As a lecturer in microbiology, he has extensive knowledge of microbes under extreme conditions.

	</div>
</div>

**Action**

During the interview, Prof. Quan mentioned many microbes adapting to extreme living conditions, which inspired us a lot. He suggested we **pay attention to the microbes that survive harsh environments on Earth**. For example, the rhodospirillaceaes, as a kind of anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria, can produce energy and saccharides through photosynthesis but not rely on oxygen to survive, which is more suitable for the hypoxic environment in space.

For the experiment design, Prof. Quan suggested we **adjust the experimental environment** to imitate the harsh environment in space. The controllable environment is more suitable for the preliminary verification of our concept.

**Review**
With the idea of Prof. Quan, we focused on **Tardigrada**, the most mysterious creatures on Earth that could survive in space, and found a special protein named mtSSB. The mtSSB protein has proved to be closely associated with **resistance to radiation, drought, and freeze**. We involved this bio-brick as the core of our survival system.

### CAU-China: How to Confer Biological Weathering Capabilities to *E. coli*

<p style="font-size: 1rem">📅 Date: Sep. 20th  👤 Participants: Zhe Dong, Yijun Wang, Siliang Zhan</p>

**Simulation**

Inspired by Prof. Li, we learned about the role of **organic acids** in Earth's weathering processes. As a result, we were planning to engineer *E. coli* to produce oxalic acid. We wondered that:

1. How to **modify the metabolic pathways** of *Escherichia coli* to enable oxalic acid production?
2. How to minimize the impact of oxalic acid on the survival of *Escherichia coli*?

**Target**

CAU-China has extensive experience in utilizing *E. coli* for oxalic acid production. Their oxalic acid secretion pathway received a nomination for the iGEM 2022 Best New Composite Part.

**Action**

We had a friendly communication with CAU-China. They informed us that oxalic acid production in *E. coli* can be achieved by **heterologous expression** of the *obcA* and *obcB* genes. Since *obcA* and *obcB* are closely located in the genome, they can be expressed under the same promoter with the same ribosome binding site (RBS). Additionally, since oxalic acid production will impact the growth of *E. coli*, they suggested we **introduce the oxalic acid efflux protein**, FpOAR, to enhance *E. coli*'s survivability in the presence of oxalic acid. Lastly, **they empowered us to adopt their oxalic acid secretion pathway** in our project.

**Review**

Through discussions with CAU-China, we established the genetic circuit for oxalic acid production. (see more details in <u>Design</u>)

## Addressing the Risk

### The Environmental Ethics: Safety and Moral Concerns

<p style="font-size: 1rem">📅 Date: Sep. 12th  👤 Participants: Qingying Yang, Yijun Wang</p>

**Stimulation**

This year, we attempted to create a biofilm that could survive in space and modify the environment of terrestrial planets. **For the interests of all mankind**, we must take any **potential risk** to the outer space environment seriously. We wondered that:

1. Would our attempt to modify the Martial environment result in irreversible damage to its ecosystem?
2. Considering that our biofilm undergoes the progress of natural evolution to adapt to the Martian environment, would our engineering bacteria prove to be a threat to mankind in the future?
3. How to deal with the safety and moral concerns of our project?

**Target**

Graduating from the University of Glasgow, UK, Dr. Yunjie Zhang is now a postdoctoral student in Environmental Ethics at the School of Philosophy, Fudan University. Studying abroad for years, she has gained an innovative insight into the environmental ethics related to human behaviors.

**Action**

Dr. Zhang pointed out that scholars in environmental ethics put an emphasis on the concept of **"wilderness"**, which is often understood as **untouched and pristine natural environments**. Philosopher William Godfrey-Smith once argued that wilderness holds multiple values for humanity. Even if humans never set foot in or utilize wilderness areas, these untouched landscapes should still be considered part of the **"moral community"** of humans. Protecting wilderness primarily involves preventing long-term human presence.

In her opinion, If we consider Mars as a "wilderness", then substantial human intervention on Mars clearly **goes against** the concept of "preserving wilderness". It is essential to **gain a deeper insight into the Martian ecological environment** before judging the extent and nature of intervention that can be considered non-destructive to the "Martian wilderness."

**Review**

Dr. Yunjie Zhang reminded us of our duty to deal with the environmental ethics issue of our project. However, she didn't offer us any suggestions in scientific ethics and biosafety since she had little understanding of biological science. She **recommended** we ask experts in biological philosophy for further guidance.

	</div>
</div>

**Re-Target**

With the suggestions of Dr. Yunjie Zhang, we turned to Dr. Mingjun Zhang for more professional suggestions on the safety and moral concerns of our project. Graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, America, Dr. Mingjun Zhang is an expert in biological philosophy and environmental ethics and is now interested in evolutionary game theory.

	<div>
		<p><small style="color: gray">Dr. Mingjun Zhang</small></p>
	</div>
</div>

**Re-Action**

Dr. Mingjun Zhang considered our project as a **relatively positive action** for the benefit of all mankind. He argued that it was our duty to **explore and understand the planet we want to transform as much as possible**.  Although there is little chance of life existing on Mars, our team should be responsible for the entire universe as well as human civilization.

The proof of concept, in his opinion, is the first issue for our project. "Currently, **the risk is controllable** so that it wouldn't cause substantial harm to the Earth, which is in line with the research norms of synthetic biology. For further development, addressing safety concerns, like **developing a "Suicide Switch"** is indispensable to limit the threat of engineering bacteria with unexpected evolution to humans. However, if the bioform is ready to be put into practice, the decision must be allowed by the rest of the world, for **Mars doesn't belong to any individual, team, or nation on Earth**."

**Re-Review**

The intersection of synthetic biology and bioethics certainly offered us a new horizon for our project. **We were fully aware of our duty and were ready to seek solutions to the safety concerns.** Although it proves to be impossible and unnecessary to bear all responsibilities or solve all problems, we will do our part and take a further step to fight for the interest of all mankind.

### Follow up with Dr. Jingwei Zhang: Feasibility of a Suicide Switch

<p style="font-size: 1rem">📅 Date: Sep. 12th  👤 Participants: Yijun Wang, Siliang Zhan</p>

**Stimulation**

Through communication with experts in environmental ethics, we were fully aware of our duty to address the safety concerns. Commonly used in the iGEM competition, a "Suicide Switch" seems to be a reliable solution. We wondered whether we could design a reliable suicide switch to avoid the potential risks of our biofilm. Since we had [established a close relationship](Dr. Jingwei Zhang: A Unique View in the Industry of Synthetic Biology) with Dr. Jingwei Zhang, we turned to him for further suggestions.

**Action**

Dr. Jingwei Zhang pointed out the potential defect of a "Suicide Switch". For one thing, **frequent genetic mutations** caused by the high radiation in space might easily silence the suicide module. For another, it would be extremely difficult to **determine when we should turn on the switch**. Even if the "Suicide Switch" could automatically respond to certain conditions such as temperature or stress, the unstable environment of terrestrial planets posed **the risk of a "False start"**.

**Review**

We found the "Suicide Switch" unreliable because of the harsh environment in space. The safety concerns are required to be addressed by other means(see more details in <u>Safety</u>)
